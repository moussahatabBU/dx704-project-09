I did not discuss this project with anyone, this was solely done by myself. I did not use an AI tools for this project. I utilized the course work as well as some other public sources to understand better how naive bayes works.
I opted not to use the existing MultinomialNB library but attempted to do the behind the scenes myself such that I can get a better understanding of how this algorithm works.
 Some of the sources I utilized are:
